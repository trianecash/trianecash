Typical payday loans have unaffordable payments, unreasonable durations, and unnecessarily high costs: They carry annual percentage rates trianglecash.com of 300 to 500 percent and are due on the borrower’s next payday (roughly two weeks later) in lump-sum payments that consume about a third of the average customer’s paycheck, making them difficult to repay without borrowing again.

In trianglecash.com the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (trianglecash.comproposed a rule to govern payday and auto title loans1 that would establish a process for determining applicants’ ability to repay a loan but would not limit loan size, payment amount, cost, or other terms. The CFPB solicited and is reviewing public comments on whether to include in its final rule alternatives to this process with stronger safeguards, particularly a “5 percent payment option” that would limit installment payments to 5 percent of monthly income, enabling banks and credit unions to issue loans at prices six times lower than those of payday lenders at scale. As such, it would be likely to win over many payday loan customers.
